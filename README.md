# The Q programming language

This is a test project for [LLVMBrewer](https://github.com/Scriptor25/LLVMBrewer), another one of my projects. Its
purpose is to make creating a programming language easier and faster, and more standardized (whatever that means). And
so far, it's working pretty good. There are some example files in the [examples](examples) directory.
